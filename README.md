# Cellular Automaton Project: Conway's Game of Life and Symmetric Encryption

## Overview

Welcome to our project repository for the Cellular Automaton project! In this project, we implement Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton simulation, and integrate symmetric encryption techniques using cellular automata principles.

### Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating simulation where cells evolve based on simple rules. It's a popular topic in the realm of cellular automata and computational science.

### Symmetric Encryption

We explore how cellular automaton rules can be applied to symmetric encryption. By leveraging the dynamic evolution of cellular automata, we demonstrate a simple yet effective encryption technique.

## Features

- **Game of Life Simulation:**
  - Generate and visualize generations of cells based on predefined rules.
  - Input custom initial configurations and observe system evolution.
  - Handle boundary conditions for a seamless simulation experience.

- **Symmetric Encryption:**
  - Encrypt and decrypt messages using the evolving states of the cellular automaton.
  - Provide options for encryption or decryption mode.
  - Support for inputting messages and viewing encrypted or decrypted output.

## Usage

### Game of Life Simulation

1. Compile and run the provided program.
2. Input the desired parameters: grid dimensions, initial live cells, and number of generations.
3. Observe the evolution of the cellular automaton.

### Symmetric Encryption

1. Compile and run the encryption program.
2. Choose encryption or decryption mode.
3. Input the message (plaintext or ciphertext).
4. View the encrypted or decrypted output.
